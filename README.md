# TrackableEventHandler
Using Vuforia for quite some time I was always irritated how they implement a 'DefaultTrackableEventHandler' without any events.
Also I believe that many tutorials on YouTube give the wrong impressions to new developers by putting all the logic inside of the handler.

Here is a real easy .unitypackage which acts almost the same as the default one with only one exception, it actually handles events.
